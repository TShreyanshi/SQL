## üîç Query:

```sql
SELECT name, class, marks,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY marks DESC) AS row_num
FROM students;
```

This uses a **window function** to calculate a new column `row_num` **on-the-fly** ‚Äî based on class-wise ordering by marks (highest first).

---

## üîÑ What Happens Internally?

This does **NOT** change the actual table.
It simply generates a **temporary result set** ‚Äî like a view ‚Äî showing the additional `row_num` column.

---

## üßæ Suppose `students` table looks like:

| id | name   | class | marks |
| -- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 1  | Aditi  | A     | 85    |
| 2  | Rohan  | A     | 95    |
| 3  | Sanya  | B     | 90    |
| 4  | Vikram | B     | 72    |
| 5  | Neha   | B     | 85    |
| 6  | Rahul  | A     | 85    |

---

## üßæ Output of your query:

| name   | class | marks | row\_num |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Rohan  | A     | 95    | 1        |
| Aditi  | A     | 85    | 2        |
| Rahul  | A     | 85    | 3        |
| Sanya  | B     | 90    | 1        |
| Neha   | B     | 85    | 2        |
| Vikram | B     | 72    | 3        |

‚úÖ Rows are ranked within each `class`, from highest `marks` down
‚úÖ Ties (like 85 in class A) get **different row numbers**: 2, 3
‚úÖ This column `row_num` is **temporary**, not stored in the table

---

## üß† Is the `row_num` permanent?

**No.** It‚Äôs a **virtual column**, added only in the result of this query.

If you want to **make it permanent**, you'd have to:

```sql
CREATE VIEW ranked_students AS
SELECT name, class, marks,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY marks DESC) AS row_num
FROM students;
```

or

```sql
INSERT INTO new_table (name, class, marks, row_num)
SELECT name, class, marks,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY class ORDER BY marks DESC)
FROM students;
```
